To run this app locally simply run from the root:

`docker compose build`

Then you can visit the app at localhost:3000 :)

The frontend builds a production (static) build in the backend container and it's served from the rails app.

To see this app in production: https://spec-comparison-089986b96f68.herokuapp.com/
